----------------------------------------------------------------------------

##### What is this project about?

> This project does x y and z without being like a but more like b.
> Initialize game by starting some setence in English. Check if it's English? --> dictionary check words. Game progresses by: one person presented w the original sentence, do their transformation of the sentence: must rewrite the sentence without using the original words (excepting articles and other words like that). Or maybe not every word can be exactly the same. Almost like a game of telephone. 
> Could have global circles on the homepage to join/participate, which queues up that person for their turn
> check in the dictionary that at least one word is different, all words are English words
> cyclical text based game but less boring than this
> Things the website can do:
> upon entering normally, can see the global games going on w/ option to join a public game. Can create an account, save being in a game?? --> or must create an account to join a game, have a limited time to respond to a game before they skip you. Order by player number. If someone leaves the game, close the loop where they left.
> another game mode basically taboo; turn-based points, time limits, each player has a little window w/ COD-esque feed on the side w the person giving a hint so they get it, don't get it. on the hinter's screens would be the black listed words, have user names
> 4-5 simple text-based games
> custom colors, make your own theme: choose your font/color/etc

##### How do I use this project?

> It is intended to be added as an application to the Web2Py framework. </br>
> To use, please download the [source distribution](http://www.web2py.com/examples/static/web2py_src.zip "Click to download.") of Web2py and clone this repository in `web2py/applications`:
```
cd web2py/applications 
git clone https://github.com/runyanjake/CJS-183-FinalProj NameOfWebsite 
```
> Then, it can be served by Web2py and viewed from a browser window: </br>
```
cd web2py/ 
python web2py.py 
```
> Follow the Web2py steps to serve the webpage and visit it in a browser. </br>

##### Contributor Etiquette
> For this project, we used a simple git etiquette. Pull requests were not used for simplicity and because the team worked physically together. For this project, we used a `commit` -> `pull` -> `push` workflow to track our changes, described simply below: </br>
Before local editing: 
```
git pull
``` 
> Editing Workflow:
```
git commit -am "foo bar baz"
git pull
git push origin <branchname/master>
```
> Auxiliary Commands:
```
git branch <branchname> (creation)
git branch -d <branchname> (deletion)
git merge <tothisbranch> <fromthatbranch> (combining branches)
git status (status)
```
